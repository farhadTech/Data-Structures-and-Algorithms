# Data Structures and Algorithms

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It contains notes, code implementations, and problem-solving exercises that I have worked on while studying DSA.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- **CP/** - Competitive Programming practice problems and solutions.
- **DSA 1 Lab/** - Lab assignments and exercises from DSA 1.
- **DSA 2 Lab/** - Lab assignments and exercises from DSA 2.
- **DSA 2 Theory/** - Theoretical concepts and explanations from DSA 2.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms/** - Implementations of various data structures and algorithms.
- **Elements of Programming Interviews/** - Solutions and explanations from the book "Elements of Programming Interviews."

## ðŸš€ Topics Covered
- **Basic Data Structures** (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, etc.)
- **Advanced Data Structures** (Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Tries, etc.)
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph Algorithms** (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Recursion and Backtracking**
- **Bit Manipulation**
- **Mathematical Algorithms**
- **Interview Preparation Questions**

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Java** - Primary programming language for implementations
- **C++** - Used for competitive programming
- **Python** - Occasionally used for problem-solving

## ðŸ“š Resources
Some of the resources I use for learning:
- **"Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen (CLRS)**
- **"Elements of Programming Interviews"**
- **LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank**
- **GeeksforGeeks & Online Tutorials**
